Accurate classification of bone marrow cells is crucial for diagnosing hematological disorders, yet integrating machine learning and deep learning models into clinical practice
faces hurdles like data privacy and data scarcity. Existing models often lack the adaptability that is important in the medical field, limiting their practicality. This study
introduces an approach using federated learning and meta-learning to tackle these challenges.
The proposed approach involves leveraging a ResNet18 backbone for the meta-learning algorithm, specifically one based on prototypical networks. This framework is then implemented
and tested in a federated manner using FedAvg across four clients, each possessing their own data. The main focus of this research is to achieve high accuracy, particularly in
unseen classes with limited samples. This approach yields promising results, achieving an accuracy of 96Â±1% in classes with low sample sizes.
